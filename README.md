# Spring Learning Projects

This repository contains a variety of projects created during my journey of learning and exploring the **Spring Framework**. These projects cover multiple concepts and modules of Spring, including:

- **Spring Core**: Dependency Injection, Java Configurations, and Bean Lifecycle.
- **Spring MVC**: Building web applications with the Model-View-Controller pattern.
- **Spring Boot**: Simplifying Spring applications with auto-configuration and embedded servers.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplified database access with Hibernate and JPA.
- **Spring Security**: Securing applications with authentication and authorization.
- **Spring REST**: Building RESTful web services.

Each project demonstrates specific concepts and is organized into its respective section.
